# Introduction to technical writing


> Technical writing is the bridge between a product and its users. 


A technical writeup should be:
- Clear
- Accurate
- Findable
- Easy to understand  

Technical writing can exist in different fields.  

## Technical writing vs UX writing
UX Writing guides users through product interface such as button labels. For users

Copy writing is sales-based, for persuasion. For 

TWriting is meant to teach. For example FAQs, software documentation etc


## Roles of a technical writer
Here are some of the roles of a technical writer:
- Create clear, accurate, and accessible product documentation for users.

- Gain product knowledge by asking questions and testing.

- Content strategy and information architecture

- Collaborate with engineering, product, support and marketing teams to identify gaps and support product releases.

- Write, edit and ship user-centred docs.

- Review docs performance and make changes. Twriting work is iterative

- Project and process management. This can be done with project management tools like Jira, Trello.

  
> As a technical writer, you need to be:
> - Comfortable not knowing at the beginning.  
> - Comfortable with asking questions as you gain knowledge by asking questions and testing.



### Here are some tips
1. A good example of a user guide or documentation is the Stripe Docs. It's really nice and kind of like a standard. 

2. Adding a What You'll Learn or Objectives-ish is a good thing for User Guides especially   
Examples of Technical documentation are FAQs, User guides, Whitepapers, API Docs

## Whitepapers

An authoritative, informative long-form piece of content that speaks on a problem and presents a solution.

Main goal is to build credibility and authority with your users.

Draws insights from heavy research, statistics, survey reports to demonstrate deep subject expertise

Differs from ebooks. Ebooks cover broader subjects unlike whitepapers that have a single focus.

## API References 
They contain info about the API (more about the endpoints and all). But API Docs contain info on how to use the API, may contain pictures, videos etc

## Release Notes
Should be accompanied by blog post link


## Skills For a Technical Writer

Attention to Details 
Communication 
Adaptability - some companies will be creating new products often. Be able to keep up with fast changes
Problem solving
Technical knowledge 
Troubleshoot: Be sure to note down issues.
Be Curious: Be comfortable with asking a lot of questions. Nope, asking questions is a huge part of your job.

## Tools Needed as a Tech Writer

- Authoring and editing tools e.g. Markdown, Notion, Grammarly, Google Docs

- Versioning tools e.g Git, Github

## A Day in the life of a technical writer
1. Meeting with support to review tickets and identify docs gaps

2. Brief sync with engineering ahead of new product release.

3. Product testing: Testing new features 

4. Reviewing Jira tickets to track incoming release or ongoing doc progress.

5. Editing and proofreading user guides


## The Assessment

Select 5 documentation and do the following for each

1. What was your experience using it? Good, bad, average?

2. What worked for you? Easy to find? Digestible? Easy to follow through?

3. What do you think would work better?



## My solution to the assessment
Please note that my solution is not a benchmark perse, it can be a guide for you especially if you're not sure where to start from. 

But I still recommend that you try answering the assessments yourself (if you want to), before checking my solution.  

### Pinterest
The pinterest documentation was helpful and easy to read. The headings were clear and easy to understand what they contained. However, I feel the documentation can be better. More pictures should be added especially regarding the parts that are instructional.  Also, it's easy to gloss over key information as they were written together with the “regular information”. Key information can be formatted differently to attract users' eyes

### Slack
The slack documentation was slightly confusing in the beginning. When I read about channels, there were two pages regarding channels before the page that contained “What is a channel?”. I'm not sure how they expect new readers to navigate the first two pages without knowing what a channel is.
Beyond that, there were visual representations of most of the instructions,  which is easy to understand.  And the fact that a user can switch the GIF tab from desktop to mobile is a good one. The headers were also clearly written and easy to understand. 



#### Assignment 1

| Product      | My experience | What worked for me                 | Suggestions for improvement | 
|--------------|---------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Pinterest     | Average       | 1. The headings weren’t ambiguous.  2. The documentation was easy to skim and understand.  | - More pictures should be added, especially regarding the instructional parts.  - Key information can be formatted differently to attract users' eyes.  - Terms specific to the product, such as “pins” or “boards,” should have been explained at the start of the documentation, not at the bottom.|
| Slack        | Good          | - There were visual representations of most of the instructions,  which were easy to understand.  - A user can switch the GIF tab from desktop to mobile.  - There’s a sidebar in the desktop version to track where I was reading.  |  I can’t think of any. |
| Docusaurus   | Good          | - There’s a link to inspiration sites built with the tool.  - The instructions were easy to understand.  |
| GitHub       |  Good         | - It was easy to follow through.  - There’s a “Where do I start” section. | - On the “Get Started” page, the tabs “Start here” and “Popular” should be more distinct from the rest of the text. They look like a single list.  |
| Grammarly    | Good          |  - It was easy to understand.        |- More lists can be incorporated |

#### How Search Engines Work: An Introductory Guide
Have you ever wondered how Google seems to have an answer for almost every question you type into its search box? From finding the nearest suya spot to helping you understand complex topics, search engines have become our go-to tools for retrieving information. But what really happens behind the scenes?

In this article, you will get to understand:
- What search engines are
- How they work
- The difference between search engines and web browsers  

Now let's dive into it. 
### What is a Search Engine?
In simple terms, a search engine is a software system designed to search for information on the World Wide Web (also known as the internet). It goes through the internet, analyses web pages, and retrieves relevant results based on user queries.  

Think of a search engine as the librarian who knows all the books in the library. You could try searching through all the books in the library for what you need, which will be really stressful.  Or you could ask the librarian who is very familiar with the books, searches for you, and brings you books related to your need. Easy!  

Some common search engines are Google, Microsoft Bing, Baidu, Yandex, and DuckDuckGo.

### Search Engines vs. Web Browsers
Sometimes,  people confuse search engines with web browsers, but they serve different purposes:

#### Web Browser
A web browser is an application used to access and interact with websites and online resources. With a web browser, you can view websites, click links, fill forms, and do much more. Common examples of web browsers are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. 

#### Search Engine
A search engine is a tool that provides answers to a user's query by displaying web pages related to the query. 
Examples include Google, Bing, Baidu, and Yahoo.

A web browser can provide several search engines for its users. For example, the Mozilla Firefox browser provides Google as its default search engine. Firefox's default search engine is Google. It allows users to use other search engines such as DuckDuckGo.  

### How Do Search Engines Work?
Most search engines operate through a three-step process: Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking.

1. **Crawling**

Search engines use automated programs called "crawlers" or "spiders" to browse the internet. These crawlers visit web pages, follow links, and collect data about the content they find.

Imagine these crawlers as the enumerators during a census, going from house to house (website to website), collecting information about each location.

 2. **Indexing**

After crawling, the search engine processes and organizes the collected data into a database (a storage) known as the "index." This index is like a more defined version of the huge library (the internet) that allows the search engine to retrieve information quickly.

During indexing, the search engine analyzes various elements of a webpage, such as:

- **Content**: The main text and information on the page.

- **Metadata**: These are short texts that describe the content of the page. 

- **Alt Texts**: Alt texts refer to the descriptions of the images on the page.

Indexing helps the search engine understand the context and relevance of each webpage.

3. **Ranking**
When you enter a query, the search engine goes through its index to find the most relevant results and then lists them. The results aren't randomly listed, they're ranked based on various factors. Some of these factors are:

- **Relevance**: This refers to how closely the content matches the user's query. 

- **Quality**: This refers to the credibility and reliability of the source.

The goal of a search engine is to present the user with the most accurate and helpful information, as quickly as possible.

### Conclusion
Understanding how search engines work can enhance your ability to find information efficiently. Also, by understanding the processes of crawling, indexing, and ranking, you can better understand how your website or blog posts can rank higher on your favorite search engine.
