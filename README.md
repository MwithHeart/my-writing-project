# MY WRITING PROJECT
This project should eventually contain a compilation of my learnings from the WriteTech Hub Bootacmp.  
Just for humor, this file says, "Hello. I'm the README, so read me."  

## About me
I am Mariam Yusuff, a creative writer exploring technical writing. I've written a few technical articles but I really want to learn the "technical" parts of technical writing. I'm totally eager to learn and grow in this field. 

## What I expect to learn from this bootcamp
Here are some of my expectations from the bootcamp:
* Help me learn Docs-As-Code at least to an extent.
* Help me understand Open Source better.
* Meet other amazing technical writers.
* Join a community of technical writers.
